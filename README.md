# snake_game_python

This project is a Python implementation of the classic snake game using the turtle module and object-oriented programming. The turtle module is a built-in library that provides a virtual canvas and drawing tools for creating simple graphics. The game consists of a snake that moves around the screen and eats food to grow its body. The player controls the snake’s direction using the keyboard keys ‘w’, ‘a’, ‘s’ and ‘d’. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own body. The score and high score are displayed at the top of the screen. This project demonstrates the use of turtle graphics, loops, lists, functions, classes and methods in Python.
